particle: track article promotion
========

`particle` is a tool for collecting data about the promotion of articles on Twitter, Facebook, Webpages, and RSS feeds (for now). It automatically joins this data together by a common url and bucketed timestamp.  This enables analysis similar to that which I discuss in this [blog post](http://brianabelson.com/open-news/2013/11/14/Pageviews-above-replacement.html). `particle` is the ideal companion to [`pollster`](https://github.com/stdbrouw/pollster), which tracks the performance of links on social media.
