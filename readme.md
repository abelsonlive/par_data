**particle**: _track article promotion_
========

**NOTE**: `particle` is no longer supported.  All functionality will be replaced and enhanced by [newslynx.org](http://www.newslynx.org)


`particle` is a tool for collecting data about the promotion of articles on Twitter, Facebook, Webpages, and RSS feeds (for now). It automatically joins this data together by a common url and bucketed timestamp.  This enables analysis similar to that which I discuss in this [blog post](http://brianabelson.com/open-news/2013/11/14/Pageviews-above-replacement.html). `particle` is the ideal companion to [`pollster`](https://github.com/stdbrouw/pollster), which tracks the performance of links on social media.
