particle: the art of promotion 
========

**particle** is a tool for collecting data about the promotion of links on Twitter, Facebook, Webpages, and RSS feeds (for now). It joins this data together by a common url and bucketed timestamp.  This enables analysis similar to that which I discuss in this `blog post <http://brianabelson.com/open-news/2013/11/14/Pageviews-above-replacement.html>`_. **particle** is the ideal companion to **`pollster <https://github.com/stdbrouw/pollster>`_**, which tracks the performance of links on social media.
